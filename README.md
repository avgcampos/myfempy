## >> Installation
### To install myfempy manually in your directory, following the steps

1. Download the main code from [github/myfempy/main](https://github.com/easycae-3d/myfempy/tree/main)

2. Unzip the pack in your preferred location

3. In the **myfempy-main** folder, open a terminal and enter with the command:

```
pip install .
```

*Note: is recommend to create a new virtual environment previously the installation of **myfempy** and dependencies packs. You can use the [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)* 

## >> Requirements

**Myfempy** can be used in systems based on Linux, MacOS and Windows. **Myfempy** requires Python 3.

### Installation prerequisites, required to build **myfempy**:
