   SfePy: Simple Finite Elements in Python
   =======================================

   SfePy is a software for solving systems of coupled partial differential
   equations (PDEs) by the finite element method in 1D, 2D and 3D. It can be
   viewed both as black-box PDE solver, and as a Python package which can be
   used for building custom applications. The word "simple" means that complex
   FEM problems can be coded very easily and rapidly.

   SfePy can use many terms to build the PDEs to be solved, see
   :ref:`term_overview`. SfePy comes also with a number of examples that can
   get you started, check :doc:`examples/gallery`, :doc:`examples` and
   :doc:`tutorial`. Some more advanced features are discussed in :doc:`primer`.
   Examples of scientific results obtained with the help of SfePy are listed in
   :ref:`example_applications`. See also :doc:`faq`.

   SfePy can be used in parallel (work in progress), see
   :ref:`solving_problems_in_parallel`.
   There is also a preliminary support for the isogeometric analysis,
   outlined in :ref:`isogeometric_analysis`.

   The easiest way to install SfePy is to use `Anaconda`_, see
   :ref:`multi_platform_distributions_notes` in
   :ref:`introduction_installation`.
